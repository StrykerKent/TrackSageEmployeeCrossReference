# Track & Sage Employee Cross Reference Web Application

This is an ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Application used to cross reference employee names and ids between an employee timesheet system (Track) from the customer and our employee payroll system (Sage). The web application showed possible matches for the clicked on employee (between Track and Sage...customer database and contractor's database). The user could then save the correct match information to the contractor payroll database (Sage).

The user can view current employees, create new employees, and update an employee's information. 

There is also a Purhase Order reference area of the web application with multiple filter and search abilities. Users can see the purchase orders that pertain to what site they work at and allowed users to update the information about the purchase orders (typical CRUD functionality). They could also download the information to Excel for further analysis.

This was created for a contractor in the Oil & Gas Industry.
